    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li class="ingredient">1 large yellow onion, or 1 small yellow and 1 small red onion</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 red pepper</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 green pepper</li>
        <li class="ingredient">[optional] fresh chilli peppers</li>
        <li class="ingredient">a handful of mushrooms</li>
        <li class="ingredient">dried cumin</li>
        <li class="ingredient">dried coriander, or a few fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li class="ingredient">[optional] dried cayenne pepper (instead of the fresh chilli peppers)</li>
        <li class="ingredient">tortillas</li>
        <li class="ingredient">400g black beens</li>
        <li class="ingredient">500g cheese</li>
        <li class="ingredient">salsa</li>
        <li class="ingredient">[optional] guacamole</li>
        <li class="ingredient">a little cooking oil</li>
    </ul>    
    <h2 class="section-heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li class="step">Finely grate all the cheese.</li>
        <li class="step">Chop all the vegetables (onion, red pepper, green pepper, chilli peppers, mushrooms) as finely as you have the patience for (or give them a quick blast in the food processor, but make sure to do them separately, else the mushrooms and peppers will be soup while the onions are still chunky).</li>
        <li class="step">Heat a little oil in a frying pan, medium heat. Fry the vegetables for a couple of minutes, but at most until the onions are soft and clear (and definitely before they start browning).</li>
        <li class="step">Put the cheese and vegetables in a big mixing bowl - including the oil the veggies fried in if there's any left.</li>
        <li class="step">Add the beans, straight out of the can/carton - don't drain them first, include the water in the bowl.</li>
        <li class="step">Add 1 tbsp of cumin, and 1 tsp of coriander, and (optionally) Â½tsp of cayenne pepper (if you didn't include chilli peppers with the vegetables). </li>
        <li class="step">Mix it all thoroughly. If it's too dry (i.e. it's not all sticking together), add an egg.</li>

        <li class="step">Repeat until all the filling mix is used up:
            <ol class="steps">
                <li class="step">Heat some more oil in the frying pan, medium-high heat. You might have to balance the heat as you go. You want it to be hot enough to brown the tortillas well, but not so hot that they bubble up.</li>
                <li class="step">Fry an empty tortilla on one side for ~10s, then flip it.</li>
                <li class="step">Spoon the filling onto one half of the tortilla to your desired thickness.</li>
                <li class="step">Fold the tortilla in half.</li>
                <li class="step">Fry the quesadilla thingy on each side for a minute or two, until the tortilla is brown and crispy.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="step">Cut into triangles with a knife or pizza cutter, and serve with salsa and guacamole.</li>
    </ol>
